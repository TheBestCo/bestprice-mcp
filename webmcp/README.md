# BestPrice WebMCP

BestPrice adds page-local WebMCP tools to the shopping journey at
[`www.bestprice.gr`](https://www.bestprice.gr/). A compatible agent can search,
inspect the products and controls that are actually on the open page, apply a
visible filter or sorting option, open a returned product, compare rendered
offers, read specifications, and inspect price history.

The shopper stays on BestPrice and keeps the final choice. There is no checkout
tool, no background account access, and no direct merchant URL in a tool result.

## Run the evaluator

The evaluator is deliberately dependency-free and uses a small deterministic
fixture. It makes no external request and is not presented as live catalog data.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheBestCo/bestprice-mcp.git
cd bestprice-mcp
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Open `http://localhost:4173/webmcp/demo/`. In a browser with WebMCP, the page
registers native tools. In an ordinary browser, the same contracts are exposed
through the built-in local inspector so every result can still be reviewed.

Run the source and manifest tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

## Source map

- [`src/contracts.js`](src/contracts.js) contains the 13 contextual tool
  contracts, schemas, and safety annotations.
- [`src/runtime.js`](src/runtime.js) owns cancellation, timeout, contextual
  re-registration, and fail-closed rollback.
- [`src/demo-adapter.js`](src/demo-adapter.js) is the deterministic evaluator
  adapter.
- [`demo/app.js`](demo/app.js) renders the human-visible page and exercises the
  same contracts without a framework.
- [`test/webmcp.test.js`](test/webmcp.test.js) pins the full journey and key
  safety boundaries.

## Production surface

Production registers only the tools relevant to the open page:

| Page | Tools |
| --- | ---: |
| Home | 1 |
| Search, category, or hub listing | 8 |
| Product page | 6 |
| Unique contracts | 13 |

The machine-readable production inventory is available at
[`/.well-known/webmcp.json`](https://www.bestprice.gr/.well-known/webmcp.json).
The inventory is informational; tools are registered by the page runtime, and
their results are derived from current first-party page state.

The BestPrice catalog, ranking system, and commerce backend predate the OpenAI
WebMCP Challenge and remain part of the main BestPrice service. The WebMCP
extension was materially expanded after the challenge opened on August 25,
2026. This directory contains the complete open-source challenge layer and a
self-contained evaluator for it.

## Safety choices

- IDs and URLs must match a product that is currently visible.
- Navigation tools can only use first-party controls that are already on the
  page.
- Read tools return bounded structured output.
- Hidden and cross-origin elements are rejected.
- Shipping that is not known remains `null`; it is never described as free.
- Offer results have no merchant click-through URL. The shopper chooses on the
  BestPrice page.
- Partial or timed-out registration aborts the whole contextual tool set.
- Tool measurement is isolated from execution and cannot break a result.
